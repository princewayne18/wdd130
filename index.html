      <p>Hello! I'm Prince Dube, from Zimbabwe currently residing in South Africa
        My life has been embeded with blessings from the Most High God even when I had lost hope due to life challenges. </p>
      <p>I have managed to obtain a bachelors degree in Accounting in the most difficult times of my life. during the 
        period of my studies, I lost my beloved mother who was so supportive in me getting my first degree. I should
         have given up, all the the odds where in the direction of me letting go of my degree but i endured till
         the end though it was not easy </p>
      <P>Growing up I had dream to run my business and become the a well known God fearing business man but after
         getting my first degree I have since diverted from my dream as im now working on getting my second degree
          which will open doors for me, as i intent to work in big Tech companies such as Microsoft or Aple Inc.</P>
